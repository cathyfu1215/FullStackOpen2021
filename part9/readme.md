# Part 9: TypeScript

This part of the project is all about **TypeScript**: an open-source typed superset of JavaScript developed by Microsoft that compiles to plain JavaScript. We will be using the tools previously introduced to build end-to-end features to an existing ecosystem with linters predefined and an existing codebase writing TypeScript.
