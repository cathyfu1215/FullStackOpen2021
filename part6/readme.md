# Part 6: State Management in React Applications

This part of the course introduces various state management solutions for React applications as they grow larger. The topics covered include:

## Flux-architecture and Redux
We introduce the **Redux library**, a popular solution for managing the state of React applications. We also cover the **Flux-architecture** and various aspects of Redux such as:
- createStore
- Pure functions, immutability
- Array spread syntax
- Uncontrolled form
- Action creators
- Forwarding Redux Store to various components

## Many Reducers
We delve into the concept of having **many reducers** in a Redux application, including:
- Store with complex state
- Combined reducers
- Finishing the filters

## Redux Toolkit
We explore the **Redux Toolkit** and its integration with console.log and Redux DevTools.

## Communicating with server in a Redux application
This section covers how a Redux application communicates with a server, including:
- Getting data from the backend
- Sending data to the backend
- Asynchronous actions and Redux Thunk

## React Query, useReducer and the context
We learn about the lightweight version of Redux directly supported by React, namely the **React context** and **useReducer hook**. We also introduce the **React Query library** that simplifies server state management. Topics include:
- Managing data on the server with the React Query library
- Synchronizing data to the server using React Query
- Optimizing performance
- Using context for passing the state to components
- Defining the counter context in a separate file

Finally, we discuss how to choose the right state management solution for your application.
