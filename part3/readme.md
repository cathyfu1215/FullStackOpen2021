# Part 3: Backend Development and Deployment

In this part, we shift our focus towards the backend, implementing functionality on the server side of the stack. We will implement a simple REST API in Node.js using the Express library, and store the application's data in a MongoDB database. By the end of this part, we will deploy our application to the internet.
